I'm originally from Germany and came to Japan in 2015 for a Masterâ€™s degree in International Relations at the University of Tokyo. After graduating I started to work as an IT recruiter in the international startup and tech space here in Tokyo. Learning about new technologies and having the opportunity to support people with their career choices are the reasons that get me out of bed every morning.
