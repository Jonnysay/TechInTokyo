What’s a good engineering resume for the Japanese job market? I spoke to hiring managers at tech companies here in Tokyo and would like to share five points that I think will make a good CV.  At the end of the article, I’ll also include a link of a sample resume format that you can use!

**Focus on the relevant but don’t limit yourself to one page**

Unlike the US, there’s no standard that limits resumes to one page in Japan. Especially for senior people with more than ten years of experience, one page can be rather short. I find two, sometimes three pages ideal to present all relevant information in detail without overwhelming the reviewer with too much text.

**Tell a (YOUR) story**

Ideally, you want to present your experience like a story that makes you look like the ideal candidate for the position you’re applying for. This means, you should focus any experience and educational background relevant for this role. For an engineering position, you could include your IT support part time job during university but you might want to leave out working as a barista at Starbucks.

**The STAR format will not only help you nail your interviews**

STAR is an acronym for “Situation, Task, Action, Results” and is the recommended interview framework for big tech companies such as Amazon. Following STAR, you will be able to organize your answers in a more logical way and it will also help you to stay on topic. You can use the same structure to describe your work experience on your resume. Many applicants only focus on Task, i.e. their responsibilities at a job and don’t mention challenges they had to overcome (Situation), the actions they personally took as well as the results and impact their work had. Those points are all as important as your job description in the eyes of the hiring managers.

**Give the reader what they want**

There’s a good chance that the person screening your resume has a certain set of keywords in their minds that they will look out for. While a hiring manager will look ideally at your experience in a more holistic way and understand transferrable skills as well, I do recommend highlighting any relevant experience you may have that relates to the job description. You don’t have to go as far as some applicants who create a customized resume for every position. Also, you shouldn’t include any keywords or technologies that you are actually not proficient in. However, putting emphasis on the most relevant skills and excluding irrelevant skills and experiences can help convincing the reviewer that you are the right candidate for the job.

**Style matters**

Finally, the format and organization of your resume should help the screener find the information they’re looking for quickly and make it easy to read. I generally include the following sections to a resume in this order: Personal information, Technical skills summary, education background, your professional experience starting with the most recent, and certifications and or honors and awards at the end. If relevant, you can also include an academic publications section at the end.

The technical skill section is the first place I look at when screening a resume myself). The second point of interest will be your current or most recent professional experience. You want to start this section from your most recent position and also allocate more space and add more detail here.

In terms of formatting and design, I like to keep it simple. Don’t add any noise distracting from the content with bright colors, symbols and photos. While Japanese resumes traditionally required a photo, it’s not the standard for English resumes (anti-discrimination laws in the US and UK) and I generally think it looks more professional to leave it out.

To exemplify all points above, have a look at my simple resume sample here and feel free to use it. I hope this information is helpful for you and as always, I’d appreciate your constructive feedback!
