Working at Merpay\
Merpay is home to some of the greatest experts within Mercari Group. Our commitment to a culture of openness allows members to discuss architecture on Slack channels organized by business domain, send pull requests to each other on GitHub, and share knowledge on the internal Wiki. We hold “Go Friday” and other weekly study groups for engineers but open to all, encouraging engineers to help one another grow. Some members have no experience developing in Go before they join, but we help turn them into Go enthusiasts early on through involvement in our internal Go community and “Gopher Dojo,” our short-term, intensive training. Members further develop their expertise while demonstrating their abilities at both internal and external engineering community events.\
